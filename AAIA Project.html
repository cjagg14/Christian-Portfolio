            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                    Cerberus is a mission concept developed by our team based on the 2025-2026 AIAA Undergraduate 
                Team Space Design Competition challenge, but it is not an official submission to the competition. 
                Instead, we are using the challenge framework as a foundation to design a realistic, forward-looking 
                space mission that explores heliophysics, space weather, and deep-space communication needs.

                    The goal of Cerberus is to help scientists and future explorers better understand how the Sun behaves, 
                how space weather evolves, and how these phenomena affect missions beyond Earth. Our concept includes a 
                suite of scientific instruments dedicated to monitoring solar activity and the local cosmic environment.

                    A major objective of the mission is to improve safety for future crewed missions to the Moon and Mars. 
                Cerberus is designed to provide early warnings of hazardous space-weather events, delivering critical information 
                to astronauts during deep-space transit and while operating on the surfaces of Mars or the Moon.

                    In addition to its science role, the mission provides near-continuous communication coverage between 
                Earth and Mars during the specified mission window (January 1, 2036 - December 31, 2049). By maintaining 
                line-of-sight relay capability, Cerberus would support reliable communication links for both crewed and 
                robotic missions throughout the inner solar system.

                    Overall, the Cerberus mission concept demonstrates how a satellite network can simultaneously advance 
                scientific understanding and strengthen the safety and communication infrastructure required for the future 
                of human space exploration.

                As part of the project, I was responsible for using ANSYS STK to design 
                and analyze the orbital trajectories for the three Cerberus satellites. 
                These spacecraft are planned to operate at key gravitationally stable locations: 
                Earth-Sun L4, Earth-Sun L5, and Mars-Sun L5. My work included determining 
                their transfer paths to these Lagrange points, calculating the ΔV required 
                to reach and maintain their positions, and ensuring they provide continuous 
                communication coverage. I also created a demonstration video of the full mission
                 trajectory, which is showcased to the left as well as the ΔV required shown below.
