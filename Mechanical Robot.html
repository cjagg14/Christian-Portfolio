            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                    In this group project, I worked with 3 other members with the goal 
                    to design a 4 bar linkage walking robot. We used different ratios 
                    of wooden lengths to find the best result that allows the robot 
                    to walk straight with a fast pace. In this project we used the 
                    software SOLIDWORKS to model the robot's parts as well as Linkage 
                    Mechanism to model the movement of the linkages.

            <p>
                In our first iteration we wanted to have the two front legs move the 
                whole robot while the back two legs drag behind. After testing out 
                this design we realized that the legs were not the right size and 
                that it would never stay upright. We also found that we can't have 
                any dragging parts so we began thinking of a new design.

            <p>
                With our second iteration, we used the similar mechanism to the 
                previous design but added two other legs simulating a walking motion. 
                With the design finished we then created a CAD drawing of the parts 
                which we used in the laser cutter allowing for accurate and precise 
                cuts. Once everything was cut out we then assembled all the pieces to 
                finish the model (as seen in the image at the top).

            <p>
                After the design was finished we brought it to the competition. 
                Once there, we tested out the completed mechanism. The robot was 
                continually catching on itself, likely due to the difference in 
                length in the drive shaft arm. When it was our time to compete our 
                robot didn't end up moving. Although our design in the end failed 
                we learned a lot about team work and determination to not give up. 
                With the first design a complete fail we recovered ourselves quickly 
                to produce a model that can meet the requirements to give ourselves 
                a chance in the competition.
